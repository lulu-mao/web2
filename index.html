                <h2>PhD Candidate in Economics</h2>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my PhD in Economics at Cardiff University. My research focuses on applied macroeconomics, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) modelling, related to housing and economic stability, with a particular emphasis on their policy implications, especially non-conventional monetary policy.</p>
                <p>With a background in econometrics and economic modelling, I strive to develop economic models to analyze economic phenomena and contribute to non-conventional monetary policy discussions. My current research examines how adjustments to the reserve requirement ratio and the interest rate corridor (the ceiling on deposit rates and the floor on lending rates) affect China's housing market.</p>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing my PhD in Economics at Cardiff University, focusing on applied macroeconomics and DSGE modeling. My research interests lie in understanding the complex dynamics between monetary policies and housing markets, with a particular emphasis on their implications for economic stability.</p>
            <p>Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I built a strong foundation in economics and finance through my postgraduate studies at Cardiff Business School:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MSc in International Economics, Banking & Finance</li>
                <li>MSc in Advanced Economics</li>
                <li>MRes in Advanced Economics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This diverse academic background has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of economic theory and empirical methods, which I now apply to my research on monetary policy and housing markets.</p>
